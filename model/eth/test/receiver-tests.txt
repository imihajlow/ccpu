1. normal operation
    process 1:
        transmit frame with MAC ok
    process 2:
        read status until ready is read
        read and check size
        read frame, check contents

2. discarded frame
    process 1:
        transmit frame with wrong MAC
        read status, must not be ready

3. buffer overrun
    process 1:
        transmit frame with MAC ok
        transmit another frame with MAC ok
    process 2:
        read status until ready is read
        read and check size
        wait until second frame transmission is finished
        read and check status
        read and check size
        read frame, check contents to be equal first frame

4. re-arm
    process 1:
        transmit frame with MAC ok
        wait for signal
        transmit another frame with MAC ok
    process 2:
        read status until ready is read
        read and check size
        read frame, check contents
        write status to re-arm the receiver
        signal process 1 to resume transmission
        read status until ready is read
        read and check size
        read frame, check contents

5. read while receiving
    process 1:
        transmit frame with MAC ok
    process 2:
        check if none of the following leads to a bus contention:
            set a to size register address, set n_oe
            set a to buffer address, set n_oe

6. reset while receiving
    process 1:
        transmit frame with MAC ok
        wait for signal
        transmit another frame with MAC ok
        signal process 2 to check status
        wait for signal
        transmit another frame with MAC ok
    process 2:
        read status until ready is read
        signal process 1 to resume transmission
        delay for half of the frame
        write status to re-arm the buffer
        wait for signal
        read status and check that ready is not set
        signal process 1 to resume transmission
        read status until ready is read
        read and check size
        read frame, check contents to be frame 3
