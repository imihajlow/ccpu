# Control unit rev. 1
Doesn't work at all: because of undefined transition states of ROM outputs random values are written into IR, A, and B.

# Registers rev. 1

## Clock phase
To work with control unit rev. 2, registers rev. 1 should be modified: pin 1 of U1 should be disconnected from clk and connected to ~clk. To do so, cut the track going west from pin 1 of U1 and solder pin 1 and pin 4 together using a short thin wire.

## Clock ringing
The CLK line rings a lot which causes total unpredictable mayhem. To overcome ringing, cut the track coming from pin 6 of U34 on the back side of the board under the chip and solder a 47 Ohm resistor into the gap. The resistor will damp parasitic oscillations.

## First instruction
Normally after reset the first instruction is not executed because of rewiring the clock phase (clock starts from 0, should start from 1 to begin a valid instruction cycle).

# ROM
All ROM chips used in ALU rev. 1, IO rev. 1, control unit rev. 1 have data pins D6 and D7 swapped. To workaround, use `tools/flip67.py` on the firmware files before flashing.

# Control rev. 2

The schematic of this board has an error: the n_oe_mem signal should be generated by a NOR gate (see control_unit.v). Instead, NAND gate U9A is used. To fix this error:

1. Unsolder U9. Cut the two tracks coming from pins 1 and 2. Solder U9 back.
2. Unsolder U16. Cut the small track between the pins 9 and 10. Cut the two tracks connecting pins 13 and 9 to GND. Solder U16 back.
3. Solder a wire to connect pin 11 of U2 and pins 13 and 12 of U16 (n_op_st signal).
4. Solder pins 11 and 10 of U16 together.
5. Solder a wire to connect pin 9 of U16 and pin 2 of U4 (n_cycle signal).
6. Solder a wire to connect pin 8 of U16 and pins 1 and 2 of U9 (oe_mem).

As a result, U9A will be used as an inverter, U16C as an OR gate and U16D as a repeater to make soldering easier.

# ALU rev. 2
Sometimes a high-frequency noise of unknown source appears. To reproduce (and test), use the following code:
```
ldi a, 127
ldi b, -127
sub a, b
```
The noise happens when the `sub` instruction is executed. Noice can be checked on any VCC pin on the ALU board or on the sa or sb buses.

To overcome this problem, solder a 10 pF capacitor between pins 1 and 7 of U36. Somehow it helps.

# IO rev. 2
Expansion boards can't be connected: connectors J2 and J6 are placed too deep into the board.

Workaround: cut ~5 mm of the board from the right side. Solder pin 6 of J6 to VCC with a wire. This way one board can be connected.

# VGA rev. 1

## RDY
The `rdy_out` signal is incorrect. The following formula must be implemented:
```
new_rdy_out = ~ext_sel | n_we | old_rdy_out
```
The signal `new_rdy_out` goes to the gate of Q1 instead of `rdy_out`. The `old_rdy_out` is the signal that is produced by the pin 3 of U24. Cut the wire coming from the gate of Q1.

The formula can be implemented with three additional N-MOSFETs (2N7002 work fine):

### Registers rev. 2
Registers rev. 2 implement the new direct (not inversed) `RDY` signal. The VGA fix remains the same, but the `new_rdy_out` signal should go directly to the `RDY` line. Q1 should be unsoldered.

## RST crosstalk

Heavy bus activity (espectially on `~we` and `a12`-`a15` lines) causes the vertical counter to randomly reset, which leads to an unstable video signal. This is caused by a crosstalk to the `~rst` line. To work around:

1. Cut the `~rst` track on the back side of the board under U30, north from the via. This way, the affected chips (U30, U16, U23) are disconnected from the old faulty line.
2. Solder pins 14 and 13 of U16 together.

# Control rev. 3

## RDY
The wait for memory system is glitchy or just wrong. Sometimes the whole system resets, sometimes behaves just wrong. Without the change of `~RDY` signal everything works fine.

This is fixed with Registers rev. 2: the `RDY` signal is handled by the clock generator.

## WE and RAM code exectution

The `~we_mem` signal is asserted at the same time with `addr_dp`. This leads to errors when code is executed from RAM: `n_we` is asserted before address bus has the valid address. Workaround: implement `~we_mem` signal delay on the control board using two MOSFETs and an RC chain. To do so, first cut the track going to pin 38 of J1 on the back side of the board. Then, solder the following:

This introduces a ~100 nS delay.
